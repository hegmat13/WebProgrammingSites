					<q id = "quote"> Ditching the cheeky, self-aware wink that helped to excuse the concept's inherent corniness, the movie attempts to look polished and 'cool,' but the been-there animation can't compete with the then-cutting-edge puppetry of the 1990 live-action movie.</q>

							<q>The turtles themselves may look prettier, but are no smarter; torn irreparably from their countercultural roots, our superheroes on the half shell have been firmly co-opted by the industry their creators once sought to spoof.</q>

							<q>Impersonally animated and arbitrarily plotted, the story appears to have been made up as the filmmakers went along.</q>

							<q>The striking use of image and motion allows each sequence to leave an impression. It's an accomplished restart to this franchise.</q>
