# WebProgrammingSites

These are all the websites that I created for CSC 337 Web Programming and each site demonstrates different web programming skills and techniques. The first few sites have a large focus on the HTML and CSS syntax and frame work. The GuessingGame and SpeedReader sites are the beginning pages that contain JavaScript, which adds more complexity to the pages. The FaceTilePuzzle uses many mouse driven events to move around HTML DOM objects which forms the basis of a fun game of rearrange the tiles. The GerryMandering and BestReads sites are among the first ones that uses a web service file to pull data from text files. The GerryMandering web service file uses the JavaScript fetch function on a url to pull data from the files using the backend service file. The ChatService is simmilar to the previous two pages and it implements an active chatting system where you could communicate with someone. Some of the basics of HTML Canvas were explored in the 8th homework where a simple page with a drawing board was implemented. A full jQuery database search was conducted on the IMDb database in the Kevin Bacon assignment. The final website utilizes all the previous knowledge from the class to create a web page for finding upcoming Raves by name and location.
