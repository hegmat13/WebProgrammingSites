The Wizard of Oz is the timeless tale of a young girl named Dorothy from a drab Kansas who is transported by a cyclone to the colorful and magical land of Oz. From the moment Dorothy's house lands in Oz, her only desire is to return to Kansas and her Aunt Em. Along the way to the Emerald City to get help from the Wizard, she meets the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion, and they accompany her with hopes of receiving their own requests.
