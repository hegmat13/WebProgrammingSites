An extraordinary adventure story with Mr. London providing a magnificent description of the bleak and forbidding northern tundra. The scenes in which Buck and his canine rivals and antagonists nearly fight to the death are brutally riveting. Don't expect character development, though. The humans in the novella are mere supporting players to Buck who returns to the wild and achieves the promise of his ancestry.
