2001 is one of the best, if not the shining pinnacle, of all the science fiction genre. Clarke is an exceptional storyteller that pulls you into the story as soon as you open the book. Though written in 1968, this book is still relevant in 2016 as mankind dreams of traveling to the stars. You've got to read the sequel books as well, and of course, watch the movie.
