"The" Pikachu
2.5
Eh, this definitely doesn't merit everything I've done. I mean, come on. When people think of Pokemon, they think of Pikachu. Some people even call me "Pokemon". They could have really upped their game in this book. The language is targeted for elementary school kids, but I've been here for over 20 years. Give me some decent action or smarts. I need some accurate character development.
